# LemonPen
LemonPen allows anybody to help make a linux distro. If you want to help, make an issue, I will add it to the project and we will get started in adding your feature. Your names will all be listed in a desktop file named "Helpers.txt", and if you wanna help, as in code, do art, and manage the project, Refer to the project "The LemonPen Project" which has a readme file that has the hiring link in it.
# WARNING
ONLY USE LEMONPEN OFF OF THE RELEASES. IF THERE ARE NONE, WAIT FOR THE FIRST RELEASE.
